# Just A Signer

## Manifesto

I've had this project in the back of my mind for a while now. 

There's a very popular notion that crypto wallets like MetaMask should provide a total 'view' into a user's current accounts. They should show token balances, display NFTs, some even going as far as providing in-app token swaps.

I feel this dilutes the actual purpose of a signer. A signer exists to sign messages with your cryptographic keys. That's it. 

It _shouldn't_ care about token balances.  
It _shouldn't_ care about prices, gain and loss, or accounting.  
It _shouldn't_ care about gas.  
It _shouldn't_ care about displaying your NFTs.

It _should_ let you create public/private keypairs securely.  
It _should_ keep your secrets secure.  
It _should_ support hardware signers.  
It _should_ show you exactly what you're signing.  
It _should_ allow you to label and manage contracts you trust, and _warn you_ when they've changed.  

It's not your window into crypto. There are a thousand dapps that do this already.  
It should be **Just A Signer**.


## Project

As a chance to learn something about GUI programs in .Net and F#. Might as well make a signer.
